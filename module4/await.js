//Async/Await allows us to writhe our code in a sequential way while still handling asynchronous code
//async: This keyword must be added to the start of a function declaration so that it becomes an “async” function
//We have to include this to make use of the await keyword
//await: This keyword must be added at the start of any function call that needs to be dealt with asynchronously
