//The Observer pattern is an OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) pattern
//It works by having one object be notified when another object changes
//There are three main components to the observer pattern:
//1.The Subject: Maintains a list of observers and manages adding/removing of observers
//2.The Observer: An interface for interacting with the objects
//3.The Objects: These are objects that have been linked to the observer
